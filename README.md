About

TalentFlow is a front-end application scaffolded with TypeScript and modern tooling (Vite + Tailwind). Itâ€™s intended as a UI for talent management/workflow features â€” listing candidates, job posts, dashboards, and more. Purpose-built for speed and developer ergonomics.

(If you want me to expand this section with a one-paragraph product vision or user personas, I can â€” Iâ€™m suspicious of vague product statements too, so Iâ€™ll ask: whoâ€™s the primary user? recruiters? hiring managers? students?) ðŸ˜‰

Features

Responsive UI (mobile-first)

TypeScript-based components and routes

TailwindCSS utility-first styling

Fast dev server via Vite

Ready for deployment (Vercel-friendly) 
GitHub

Note: Exact app features (candidate flow, auth, API) depend on the src/ implementation. If you'd like, I can scan the src and add a specific features list.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Node.js (recommended LTS)

npm or yarn (repo includes package-lock.json, so npm is fine). 
GitHub

Local setup

Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/Nikhil711-maker/TalentFlowNew.git
cd TalentFlowNew


Install dependencies

npm install
# or
# yarn


Run the dev server

npm run dev


Open your browser:

http://localhost:5173


(Port may vary; Vite will show the actual URL in your terminal.)

Available Scripts

These are the typical scripts for a Vite + React + TypeScript project. If your package.json differs, use the names from it.

npm run dev       # start dev server (Vite)
npm run build     # build production bundle
npm run preview   # preview production build locally
npm run lint      # linting (if configured)

Project Structure (Suggested / Typical)
â”œâ”€ public/                 # static assets
â”œâ”€ src/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ components/          # UI components
â”‚  â”œâ”€ pages/               # route-level components
â”‚  â”œâ”€ styles/              # global styles, tailwind entry
â”‚  â”œâ”€ main.tsx             # app entry
â”‚  â””â”€ vite-env.d.ts
â”œâ”€ index.html
â”œâ”€ package.json
â”œâ”€ tsconfig.json
â””â”€ tailwind.config.ts


If you'd like, I can generate a documented file tree from your src/ (I can parse the repo and create a section listing main components/routes).

Contribution Guidelines

Fork the repo and create a feature branch:

git checkout -b feat/your-feature


Make focused commits (one small change per commit).

Push and open a pull request explaining the change.

Add unit or UI tests for critical behavior (if you use a test framework).

Be skeptical of feature creep â€” if it's not adding clear value, leave it out. ðŸ˜„

Troubleshooting

Dev server wonâ€™t start: ensure Node version is compatible; delete node_modules and reinstall.

Styles not applied: confirm Tailwind is configured and index.css imports the Tailwind directives.

Build fails: check TypeScript errors (npm run build will show the failing file).

If you paste your terminal error here, Iâ€™ll fix it with surgical precision.

Next steps / Suggestions (optional)

Add a clear CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.

Add CI (GitHub Actions) for linting & build.

Add unit / component tests (Vitest + React Testing Library).

Add an API README describing any backend endpoints or mocks.

If you want, I can produce a short docs/ folder with component usage examples and screenshots.

License

Add a license file (LICENSE) if you want others to reuse the code. Common choices:

MIT â€” permissive and popular

Apache-2.0 â€” permissive with patent grant
